    RISK_DESCRIPTION: 'Your risk profile is determined based on your responses, guiding you towards the most suitable investment strategy. A Low Risk profile suggests a preference for safety and stability, prioritizing the preservation of capital through secure, low-yield investments like savings accounts and government bonds. A Moderate Risk profile indicates a balanced approach, combining both safe and growth-oriented investments to achieve moderate returns while managing risk. Lastly, a High Risk profile reflects a willingness to embrace significant risks for the potential of higher returns, with a portfolio that may heavily feature stocks and high-yield assets, aiming for substantial capital appreciation over time.'
